# Foodease

[My Notes](notes.md)

My startup is a recipe sharing website named Foodease. The platform allows users to discover, save, and share interesting recipes. Users can submit recipes they enjoy, and others can view and save these submissions.

## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [ ] Proper use of Markdown
- [X] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [X] Description of key features
- [ ] Description of how you will use each technology
- [ ] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Foodease is a streamlined social platform that makes recipe discovery and sharing effortless. Think of it as a curated cookbook built by food enthusiasts, for food enthusiasts. Unlike overwhelming recipe websites, Recipe Hub focuses on simplicity - users can quickly share their favorite recipe discoveries, organize them into collections, and engage with a community of home cooks. Whether you're looking for tonight's dinner inspiration or wanting to build your personal recipe collection, Recipe Hub provides a clean, user-friendly experience without the clutter of lengthy blog posts or intrusive ads. It's the modern solution for the age-old question: "What should I cook today?"

### Design
